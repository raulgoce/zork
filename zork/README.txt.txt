HELLO WORLD!

Wellcome to my first C++ text game!

This is a short adventure choice game. I'm going to explain a little bit what's the game about.

First you will read an explanation of the basic commands. Then you will find a basic intro where I ask the name of the player.
Then the game starts! 
To move I set the xposition and y position to 0. You have 4 basic options, north, west, south, east. To move the player I set the x position and y position
relative to the coords. For example, if the player wants to move north, I set Y+1. With a recursive call I check where is the player now and I move show where he is.
Plus, the player can enter places aswell as interact with objects. 
You have one item, the backpack, and in there you can store other items. You will have to find them!
There is an NPC too!
To make the game I base it in conditionals since I thought it was better for the style of my game since the narrator takes big participation in this game. 
You have three diferent endings, be carefoul with your steps! I hope the main final please you, it's the most hilarious. 
It's not a very efficient nor optimal code, but since I've been working with C++ two weeks, I'm pretty proud of myself! I know I have A LOT to learn! I'm on it!

Any suggestions are welcomed.
I hope you like it.

PS: I had dificulties to work with Visual Studio 2017 since my pc is not working very well. I tried with code blocks, but the .exe works just fine. In code blocks has 0 warnings.
